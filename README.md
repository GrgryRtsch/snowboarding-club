-  As a First Time Visitor, I would also like people to be able to find out about our other social platforms and the people who use and reccomend us.

-  Returning Visitor Goals
-  As a Returning Visitor, they would need to be given information on our meet-up times to stay up to date with everythhing happening in and around the club.
-  As a Returning Visitor, should be able to see the gallery of all of our previous meet-ups where they may-be featured.
-  As a Returning Visitor, should be using all of the links provided at the footer of the page.

##  Design

###  Colour Scheme

-  I would like the hero colour to be blue. and maybe some darker greys and white.

###  Typography
-  
-  I would like the main font to be used throughout the web pages to be Lato.

-  I would like some of the imagery to be running behind the page. One of the images I have in mind would be a man pointing toward the contact info in ski gear.
