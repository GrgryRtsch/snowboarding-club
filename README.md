  click between our different pages which will include a Gallery, Homepage and an events page. With social media links availible at the footer of the page and information and imagery inbetween those two parts.

## User Goals

- First Time Visitor Goals
- As a First Time Visitor, I would like the goal to be that people interested in snowboarding sign up to our club / contact us.

- As a First Time Visitor, I would also like people to be able to find out about our other social platforms and the people who use and reccomend us.

- As a Frequent User, I want to be able to see what my friends are saying about continued meet-ups.
- As a Frequent User, I may want to contact the club to find out something more specific and am looking for the phone number.

## Design

As the snow is a big part of snowboarding I chose to make my website prodominantly white with cool greys and charcoals throughout the pages. The imagery brings the hero element to the page and gives a visual focus point, whilst the card sections contain information displayed in a way which is smart looking and easy to digest. So we have bright imagery with cool colored backgrounds.

## Colors Chosen

- The colors which formed the basis of my website were; #6c83a2, #4b4d4f, #444, #333, and white.

## Typography

- Sans Seriff, main font of choice.

## Imagery

- The index.html hero image is a panoramic veiw of the mountains, in which I thought perfectly captured the feeling I wanted to set around the website.
- The gallery.html page contains a mixture of scenery and snowboarding action shots.
- The events.html page has a hero image of friends hanging out on the slopes tying up their snowboarding boots.

## Tecnologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS

## Interactive elements

- The nav bar takes you from page to page and has a drop down menu with your different page options on.
- The gallery.html page contains a carousel with automatically rotating images which can be manually changed as well.
